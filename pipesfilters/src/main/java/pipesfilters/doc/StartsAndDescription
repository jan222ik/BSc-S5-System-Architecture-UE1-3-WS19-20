Starting: java -jar pipesfilters.jar (when in same directory)
Program arguments:  -overwrite (output file is overwritten when exists in same directory as jar)
                    -input="exampleInput.txt" (file to be indexed, can be full or relative path)
                    -freqWords="exampleFreqWords.txt" (file with the frequently used english words to filter, can be full or relative path)
                    -freqLower=150 (number for frequency limit for frequently used words, words with frequency less than this number won't be considered, default:100)
                    -line=100 (desired length of lines for task b in characters, minimum: longest uninterrupted (no whitespaces) string + 1, default:120)
                    -layout=CENTER (desired alignment of text; allowed values: LEFT, CENTER, RIGHT, default: CENTER)
                    a (execute pipeline from task a -> only index)
                    b (execute pipeline from task b -> index and aligned text)

                    Mandatory: -input, -freqWords, either a or b (otherwise, there will be no output)

Example start commands (assuming console is used in same directory as jar):
java -jar pipesfilters.jar -overwrite -input=aliceInWonderland.txt -freqWords=frequentEnglishWords.txt a
(if the input file and the frequent words file are in the same directory as the jar and former output exists)

java -jar pipesfilters.jar -overwrite -input="C:\Users\Matt\IdeaProjects\S5SysArch1\pipesfilters\out\artifacts\pipesfilters_jar\aliceInWonderland.txt" -freqWords="C:\Users\Matt\IdeaProjects\S5SysArch1\pipesfilters\out\artifacts\pipesfilters_jar\frequentEnglishWords.txt" b
(if the input file and the frequent words file are not in the same directory and an output file already exists)

java -jar pipesfilters.jar -overwrite -input=aliceInWonderland.txt -freqWords=frequentEnglishWords.txt -freqLower=200 -line=120 -layout=RIGHT b
(files in same directory, output shall be overwritten, set lower bound of frequency to 200, length of line in chars to 120, layout to right-bound and use the pipeline from task b)

Solution for filtering out frequently used words at beginning of circular shifts:
Happens in the WordCirclerFilter (since the shift only needs to be discarded when the frequent word is at the beginning of a shift).
The check is done by a self-written class, MostFrequentWordsTrie. A trie is a kind of search tree that is usually used to search for strings.
The MostFrequentWordsTrie extends the Trie-class (our own implementation of a trie).
The Trie-class can add words and check whether a string is contained in the tree.
The MostFrequentWordsTrie gets a file and an integer as parameters. The file is the file containing the most frequent words to filter,
the integer is the bound for the frequency. Words that appear with less frequency than this bound are not considered when checking for
frequent words at the beginning of shifts. The MostFrequentWordsTrie uses these parameters in its only added method, addWordsFromFile.
This method reads all lines from a file and matches said lines with a regex. If the regex matches and the number in the frequency column
of the line is greater than the lowerFrequencyBound parameter, the word is added to the Trie.
While performing the circular shifts in the WordCirclerFilter, a MostFrequentWordTrie is used to check whether the word at the beginning of
a shift is in the trie or not. If it is not in the trie, the shifted line is used further. Otherwise, the line is not used and disappears.
